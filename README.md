## Who is Ritesh Khatri

An experienced software engineer with a strong proficiency in Java, Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Framework, Oracle DB-19C, Python, and more. I have experience in both backend and frontend development and have worked on projects for clients such as HDFC and AT&T.
My expertise lies in developing microservices integrated with third-party and internal systems, as well as streamlining CI/CD processes to enhance efficiency and elevate the quality of deliverables. I am a strong believer in DevOps practices and have experience in agile methodologies.
In my current role at Oracle, I conduct proof of concepts (POCs) to identify and recommend new technologies for project enhancement, participate in project planning, and contribute to the design of system architecture. I am skilled in tools such as Jenkins, Gradle, Helm, and Kibana and have worked with platforms such as Android Studio and Google Firebase.
I am passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions that meet client needs and exceed expectations. I am a dedicated team player and enjoy mentoring and guiding new joiners to help them succeed in their roles.

Moreover, Ritesh Khatri is eager to explore novel technologies, continuously expanding his knowledge domain and skill set.
